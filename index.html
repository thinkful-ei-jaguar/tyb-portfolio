            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a burgeoning full-stack web developer based in Raleigh, NC. I got my first taste of coding while earning my English degree in college. My degree was focused in professional writing and editing, and part of that curriculum introduced me to basic HTML and CSS coding which I really enjoyed. I have since tried other potential career paths, but I rediscovered coding, and I decided to give it a real shot. </p>
            <p>What’s really sold me on the idea of coding is the fact that you get a tangible result from your work and that it is a field where you get to work through problems with a team around you. I’ve got a craving for creative outlets, including many forms of storytelling and art, but I also enjoy getting to employ the side of me that enjoys working with technology.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding, I am either hanging out with my husband and playing with my little fluff pup, or I am creatively solving fantasy world challenges with my friends playing Dungeon and Dragons. As you can see, I’m an all-around nerd!</p>
